### Abstract
&nbsp;    Electron is an open-source framework developed and maintained by GitHub. Electron allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using web technologies: It combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime. Electron is the main GUI framework behind several notable open-source projects including Atom, GitHub Desktop, Light Table, Visual Studio Code, and WordPress Desktop. The fact that the project is under active development can be deduced from the speed at which pull requests are merged. Until 2019-10, it has 22559 commits, 140 branches, 628 releases ,1036 issues, and 889 contributors.

### Introduction
&nbsp;   Electron allows for the development of desktop GUI  applications using web technologies, such as javascript , html and css. This chapter gives a structured overview of Electron by providing descriptions of the various parts that compose its architecture, in order to explain the system and how it works. Several aspects of electron are analyzed, starting with the stakeholders. After that We give a context view to describe the different components involved and a development view to outline how electron is developed and the ways in which contributions can be made.

### StakeHolder
&nbsp;    Many stakeholders played a part in the project Electron.
### Assessors
&nbsp;    Assessors oversee the system's conformance to standards and legal regulations. And we can also say assessors are the core developers. The team of this project is consisted of 6 core developers and many other developers. As the projects are still in development Control the quality of submitted code and guide the project to the right direction step by step. 

### Communicators
&nbsp;     The people or introductions that explain the architecture of the project are the communicators. The biggest communicator is the electron development team , called Work group(WG). Now there are 6 core members. And chairman is @jkleinsc . Besides, the community—github plays a very important role, who provides the place where developers can put up the documentation and get the bug reports about the project through the issue tracker.

### Developers
&nbsp;    There are two kinds of developers. The one is core developers, the other is contributors.
core developers: they hand up most of the commits, The success of the project today can not be separated from their efforts. @zcbenz, who have handed up 6086 commits , and @kevinsawicki , who has handed up 2138 commits, are the core developers of electron. They contributed the most to the project before 2017 and after 2017, respectively. 
contributors: they contributed the development of the project more or less. And their commits need to be examined by WG. Until 2019/10/3 , there are 889 contributors.

### Maintainers
&nbsp;    The maintainers of the project are @jkleinsc and his team will deal with all the problems and bugs after checking the bug reports, oversees all release branches, and tooling to support releases.

### Support Staff
&nbsp;    Also the WG, they need to:
Releasing Electron according to schedule
Release timeline coordination
        ◦ When to cut new branches for major and minor release lines (e.g. v3.0 -> v3.1)
        ◦ Planning beta cycles, timelines, etc.
        ◦ Listening and responding to feedback
Management of Heroku apps for associated repositories.
### Users
&nbsp;    There are mainly two kinds of users:
Workers: This project can be used by developers to develop many desktop projects. 
Learners: In the term of education, it can be used both in teaching and learning, such as javascript, html , css and so on.

### Sponsors
&nbsp;    Electron used to be called [Atoms shell], it is used to develop the editor
[Atoms] by github , so github is the inventor ,and also the biggest sponsor of electron. Besides, many individual developers sponsored the project. They definitely support the project and their or their companies’ logo will be shown in the Github.


### Competitors
&nbsp;    Other frameworks for desktop application development, like QT, etc.

### System Quality Attributes
For this system，some quality attributes seems to be of great significance.

Performance: Because this product is a framework that allows cross platform desktop application development, so the performance is very important. It must be Interface friendly and have strong functions so that it can be used to develop beautiful and powerful applications.

Usability: Only if the users think this framework is easy to use will they choose the product. An easy-to-use framework is easy to focus more users, and it is also convenient to have more users and better optimization framework. On the other hand, it must have the functions that a qualified development tool should have，No programmer will tend to choose a development tool with incomplete functions.

Portability: Many frameworks have the ability of cross platform development(for example, QT). Without this ability, they will not have the advantages in the market. 

Power versus Interest
We extend upon the previous classification of stakeholders to include the power and interest of the various stakeholders. We do so by means of a power interest grid, of which the result is shown below. The stakeholders are classified into 4 categories.

Low power and low interest.
In general, I think all of the above mentioned stakeholders are somewhat interested in this project. Relatively speaking, it should be that as a sponsor, there will be less specific development interest in this project, only involving investment and application. 

High power and low interest.
there are the programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JS, this group has no interest in Electron, but does have more power as the whole codebase consists of them cause they are hardly replaceable.

Low power and high interest.
Users, competitors, and contributors of Electorn are stakeholders who are greatly interested in Electorn but can hardly do something for it. Programmers that use Electorn itself or use it ,Obviously they care about how they feel about using this framework. But generally speaking, they don't have a lot of power. If this framework is going down, they will tend to choose other frameworks. From this point of view, competitors obviously want to know their competitors so as to learn from each other. Contributors are involved in the development of the project, so they are also interested in the project.

High power and high interest.
GitHub is the initiator of this development framework and provides the whole development community and communication platform. Besides, it's the core developer.(the release WG) .At the same time, they also act as reviewers, guiding the direction of the whole project.
They both have high power and high interest.

### Context view
&nbsp;    The diagram below in Figure 1 shows the context view of Electron. The view shows the different relations, dependencies and interactions Electron has with its environment. In this section we will provide some short explanations.

Figure 1: Electron context view 
 
#### `Development tools`
You can use the native Node. JS development environment to develop Electron applications. In order to build an Electron desktop development environment, you only need to install Node.js, NPM, a handy code editor, and a basic understanding of your OS command line client.
We recommend that you use GitHub's Atom or Visual Studio Code. These two popular editors are developed by Electron. And support for JavaScript is great.
#### `Test Framework`

WebDriver is an open-source automatic testing tool supporting multiple browsers. 
It provides the ability to operate web pages, user input, JavaScript execution, etc. 
Chrome driver is an independent service that implements the connection protocol between WebDriver and chrome. 
It was also developed by the team that developed chromium and WebDriver.

#### `Communication tools`

Electron	 uses Github and Git for	 version control to help developers collaborate and track issues related	to the software. Contributions in	the repository come from the Electron software development	team, as well as from the open-source community. In order	to stay in contact with developers and users	the community of Electron are built.

#### `Software developed by Electron`
If you can build a website, you can build a desktop application. Electron is a framework for creating native programs using Web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is responsible for the more difficult parts. You just need to focus on the core of your application. With Electron, you can easily create desktop applications or ideas for your company.

#### `Competitor`

PWA can provide most of electron's main functions.
Google, Microsoft and apple are investing heavily in PWA. Microsoft has publicly said its Microsoft team on windows is moving from electron to PWA.

#### `License`

MIT——Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software.

#### `Dependencies`

Electron works by merging chromium and node. JS into the same runtime environment and packaging them as applications under Mac, windows and Linux systems.

### Deployment
#### `Setting up`
```sh
# This command should print the version of Node.js
node -v

# This command should print the version of npm
npm -v
```
#### `A good Editor`
We might suggest two free popular editors built in Electron: GitHub's Atom and Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. Both of them have excellent JavaScript support.

If you are one of the many developers with a strong preference, know that virtually all code editors and IDEs these days support JavaScript.
#### `Install`
```sh
npm i electron@latest
# or
npm install --save-dev electron
```
#### `Create Your Own Project`
Create a new empty folder for your new Electron application. Open up your command line client and run npm init from that very folder.
```sh
npm init
```
npm will guide you through creating a basic package.json file. The script specified by the main field is the startup script of your app, which will run the main process. An example of your package.json might look like this:
```sh
{
  "name": "your-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "main.js"
}
```
Note: If the main field is not present in package.json, Electron will attempt to load an index.js (as Node.js does). If this was actually a simple Node application, you would add a start script that instructs node to execute the current package:
```sh
{
  "name": "your-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ."
  }
}
```
Turning this Node application into an Electron application is quite simple - we merely replace the node runtime with the electron runtime.
```sh
{
  "name": "your-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron ."
  }
}
```

#### `QuickStart`
```sh
#Clone the Quick Start repository  
$ git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start  
#Go into the repository  
$ cd electron-quick-start  
#install the dependencies and run  
$ npm install && npm start  
```

### Development View
#### `High-level view`
Electron apps is developed using JavaScript, and its working principle and method are the same as that of node.js.
When users want to develop an Electron application, they should write the main.js file with electron module, which contains all the APIs and functions provided by Electron. Then, they can create the index.html they want to show. Last, they should create a new empty folder for their new electron app. And open their command line tool and run npm init from this folder. npm will help them create a package.json file. After creating and initializing main.js, index.html and package.json, they can start the newly written electron program by executing the npm start command in the root directory of the current project.
 ![image](https://github.com/megumigachi/electron/blob/master/ppic/dev.png)
#### `Codeline Organization`
The codeline organization is the way that the source code is stored in a directory structure, managed via configuration management and how it is built and tested regularly. In an open source project, it is important to organize the source code in a way that everyone can understand it and can edit it.
The code line organization of Electron is shown in the figure below. Following will be explanation for some parts in the structure.
```sh
atom/
```
The “app/” under “atom” is the entrance of the program. “ui/” under “browser” contains the code for user interface on different platforms. The code of realizing API in the program is in “api/” under. Code used by both the main process and the rendering process is contained in “common/”.
```sh
chromium_src/
```
The files in /chromium_src are more fragments of chrome than parts at the content level.  For example, to implement the Paper API, we need some join operations similar to the official chrome We may have built the corresponding source file as part of libcc, but most of the time we don't need all the features (some for special purpose and analysis), so we use part of its code These patches may easily exist in libcc, but the patches maintained when writing the target libcc are very small, and the change of chromium ﹣ SRC is often great In addition, please note that unlike other libcc patches we maintain, these patches cannot be pushed upstream.
```sh
default_app/
```
Code for the default page of Electron when no application is supplied.
```sh
lib/
```
Source code of JavaScript.
```sh
spec/
```
automated testing
There are some other directory such as script, tools, vendor, etc. They have different functions. For example, “tools/” contains the scripts used in gyp files should not be called directly by users.
 ![image](https://github.com/megumigachi/electron/blob/master/ppic/folder1.png)
#### `Continuous Integration`
Electron is based on chromium, so a display driver is needed to make it work. If chromium can't find a display driver, Electron fails to start, so no matter how we run it, Electron won't perform any of our tests. When testing Electron   applications based on Travis CI, Circle CI, Jenkins, AppVeyor or similar systems, some configuration is required. Essentially, we need to use a virtual display driver.
 Firstly, install Xvfb. This is a virtual frame buffer, which implements X11 display service protocol. All graphics operations are performed in memory, and do not need to be displayed on any screen output device. 
Then create a virtual screen instance (Xvfb), and export the DISPLAY variable, which stores the reference of the virtual screen. Chromium in Electron will automatically find $DISPLAY, so the application doesn't need to be configured again. This step can be automated through xvfb-maybe of Paul Betts: if the system needs to, add your test command before xvfb-maybe, and then this gadgets will automatically set up xvfb. In windows or MacOS, it doesn't do anything. 

#### `Testing Approach`
Webdriver is an open-source automatic testing tool supporting multiple browsers. It provides the ability to operate web pages, user input, JavaScript execution, etc. ChromeDriver is an independent service that implements the connection protocol between WebDriver and chromium.
Disposing Spection. Spectron is the ChromeDriver testing framework officially supported by Electron. It's built on top of WebdriverIO and helps you access the Electron API and bind ChromeDriver in your tests.
Configuration via WebDriverJs or WebdriverIO. WebDriverJs and WebdriverIO is a node module that can be tested with WebDriver.
Workflow. No need to recompile Electron, just put the source code of app into Electron's resource directory and start testing directly.


### Functional View
The functional view defines the architectural elements that deliver the described system functions. This view records the key runtime functional elements, their responsibilities, interfaces, and major interactions. In electronic projects, different key functional elements interact with internal and external elements at runtime. But these functional elements behave like interfaces because they have well-defined functions that can be called by other elements to perform different operations.

We know electron is a framework, we need to install this library through NPM, and then create its instance project, the official provided us with a quick start.

https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start

The initialized instance project is like that in the link,we can call it ‘helloworld ‘ in Electron.

Electron core we can divide into two parts, the main process and the rendering process. The main process connects the operating system to the rendering process and can be viewed as a bridge between the page and the computer. The rendering process is now familiar with the front-end environment. It's just the carrier has changed, from the browser to the window. Traditional web environment we can not operate on the user's system. Electron corresponds to the node environment, and we can use all the node apis in the project.

The complete project structure after installing the project dependencies is shown in the following figure:

 ![image](https://github.com/megumigachi/electron/blob/master/ppic/fun1.png)

Node_modules: module dependencies
Package. json: the file that describes the package, where the main process entry file is configured as main.js by default.
Main. Js: main process
Create the mainWindow browser window in the main process and load the index.html home page using the mainwindow.loadurl ("file://${succs name}/index.html"). Use the mainWindow. WebContents. OpenDevTools () to open the developer tools for debugging (this operation is usually released app delete).1, ready: triggered when Electron finishes initialization, the browser window will be created and the main page will be loaded after initialization.2. Window-all-closed: triggered when all browser Windows are closed, it usually exits the application.3, activate: this is triggered when the app is activated, and is typically handled against macOS.Index.html: is a web page that needs to be loaded and displayed using a BrowserWindow, which is in a separate rendering process as the application's UI.
Renderer. Js: rendering process, its operation is similar to the js operation in web, so it is better to have the basic knowledge of the syntax of node.js, js and es6, so that it can be developed with ease.The project operation process is as follows:When the app starts, execute the code in main.js to create Windows, load pages and so on. The rendering process renderer. Js renders the page, communicates with the main process and transmits data, etc. However, the main process and the rendering process cannot directly access each other, and IPC communication needs to be conducted through ipcMain and ipcRenderer.

The figure shows the functional view.

### Technical Debt  
Technical debt reflects on the long-time impacts of trade-offs that are taken during software development between productivity and maintainability. Electron is built on two major upstream projects: Chromium and Node.js. Each of these projects has several of their own dependencies, too. Electron tries its best to use these dependencies exactly as they are but sometimes it can't achieve its goals without patching those upstream dependencies to fit its use cases.
#### Patch justification
Every patch in Electron is a maintenance burden. When upstream code changes, patches can break—sometimes without even a patch conflict or a compilation error. It's an ongoing effort to keep our patch set up-to-date and effective. So Electron strives to keep our patch count at a minimum. To that end, every patch must describe its reason for existence in its commit message.
#### Test Debt
  Electron has its test method. The goal is to maintain high coverage of electron code. Electron requires that all pull requests not only pass all existing tests, but also add new tests to cover the changed code and new scenarios. Electron need to cover as many code paths and use cases as possible in the electron application to ensure that the applications it publishes have fewer bugs
  
### Evolution Perspective
Electronic version release is quite frequent. Whenever there are important bug fixes in node.js, new API or version update, Electron will release new version.
#### Edition 1.x
The electronic version less than 2.0 does not follow the semver specification: the major version corresponds to the change of end-user API, the minor version corresponds to the main version of Chromium, and the patch version will bring new functions and bug fixes. Although it is convenient for developers to merge functions, it brings troubles to developers who are facing client applications QA test cycle of major applications such as Slack, Stride, Teams, Skype, VS Code, Atom and Desktop may be very long, and stability is a very ideal result When trying to absorb bug fixes, the risk of adopting new features is high.
#### Edition 2.0 and later
The 1. X strategy listed below has several major changes Each change is to meet the needs and priorities of developers / maintainers and application developers.
1.Strict use of semver
2.Introducing semver compliant beta Tags
3.Import general submission message
4.Well defined stable branch
5. master branch has no version information, only the stable branch will contain version information
From 2.0, electron will follow semver.
Here is a table that explicitly maps the changed types to their corresponding semver categories (for example, major, minor, patch).
Major version increment	Minor version increment	Patch version increment
Electron breakthrough API change	No breakthrough API change for electron	Electron bug fix
Node.js major version update	Node.js minor version update	Node.js patch version update
Chromium version update		Fix related chrome patches

### conclusion
Electron is an open source library developed by GitHub for building cross-platform desktop-applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron accomplishes this by combining Chromiumand Node.js into a single runtime and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
Electron began in 2013 as the framework on which Atom, GitHub's hackable text editor, would be built. The two were open sourced in the Spring of 2014.
It has since become a popular tool used by open source developers, startups, and established companies. See who is building on Electron.
Read on to learn more about the contributors and releases of Electron or get started building with Electron in the Quick Start Guide.
Electron is maintained by a team at GitHub as well as a group of active contributors from the community. Some of the contributors are individuals and some work at larger companies who are developing on Electron. We're happy to add frequent contributors to the project as maintainers. Read more about contributing to Electron.
Electron releases frequently. We release when there are significant bug fixes, new APIs or are updating versions of Chromium or Node.js.
Electron's version of Chromium is usually updated within one or two weeks after a new stable Chromium version is released, depending on the effort involved in the upgrade.
When a new version of Node.js is released, Electron usually waits about a month before upgrading in order to bring in a more stable version.
In Electron, Node.js and Chromium share a single V8 instance—usually the version that Chromium is using. Most of the time this just works but sometimes it means patching Node.js.
As of version 2.0 Electron follows semver. For most applications, and using any recent version of npm, running $ npm install electron will do the right thing.
The version update process is detailed explicitly in our Versioning Doc.
Long term support of older versions of Electron does not currently exist. If your current version of Electron works for you, you can stay on it for as long as you'd like. If you want to make use of new features as they come in you should upgrade to a newer version.
A major update came with version v1.0.0. If you're not yet using this version, you should read more about the v1.0.0 changes.
In order to keep Electron small (file size) and sustainable (the spread of dependencies and APIs) the project limits the scope of the core project.
